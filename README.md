Keylogger is a software that tracks the key presses on your PC or desktop computers.
Generally hackers use this software to exploit your system to get the info.
By everytime you press a key this will be stored in log file.
An attacker uses another technique to extract this log file from your system.
These softwares works differently on different Operating Systems (OS).
The source codes are shared in my repository for both Linux and windows OS.
Please use it for only educational purposes.
